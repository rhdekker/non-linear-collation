        <para>Textual scholars have at their disposal an increasing number of digital tools and
            technologies to examine the genesis of a literary work. We can model or capture a wide
            variety of (complex) textual phenomena, and our analysis of them, in a digital
                transcription.<remark>Define "digital transcription": this ranges from plain text to
                MS Word to TEI/XML. Suggestion: "A 'digital transcription' can be anything from
                plain text to MS Word and TEI/XML. Unless explicated otherwise, this paper uses the
                term (digital) transcription to refer to a TEI/XML transcription."</remark> This
            transcription can subsequently be processed by various tools for further analysis or
            visualisation. Simply put, transcribing and processing text are forms of translation,
            from one sign system to another. Making a transcription is generally understood to be a
            critical act of editorial interepretation <xref linkend="robinson_1993"/><xref
                linkend="pierazzo_2015"/>, and we can say the same about text processing: a tool
            performs multiple operations on a text, each operation involving a transformation of the
            data. It follows that before we can influence/customize a tool, it is necessary to
            understand its workings and the transformations a text undergoes. This, in turn, can
            lead to a more fitting/adequate/suitable framework to investigate/model a text.</para>
        <para>An interesting area of study, and one that poses some particularly challengeing
            issues, is the automated collation of modern manuscripts. This type of documents often
            contains (heavy) revisions and complex sites of textual variation which are challengeing
            to adequately capture and process in TEI/XML. In short, the genetic orientation to text
            examines a text's development and the creative processes that propegate literary
                invention<remark>[REF Shillingsburg and Van Hulle 2015]</remark>. As the genetic
            orientation studies the processes of writing and revising, it is vital that revisions
            are included in the collation process, so that researchers can study both the revision
            within one document and the revision across document borders. The present paper
            discusses how human interaction with collation algorithms benefits this kind of
            research. This issue has been previously explored in <remark>[REF to paper ESTS
                2016]</remark>, focusing on one characteristic of textual revisions - substitutions
            - where the word order is of importance. The TEI/XML transcriptions of the modern
            manuscripts of Samuel Beckett and Raymond Brulez serve as case studies.</para>

        <title>Ordered</title>
        <para>When a manuscript or typoscripts contains additions and deletions these can be
            regarded/viewed as multiple orders through a text. Given two transcriptions, one for
            each witness, to goal is to find the order through both witnesses with largest
            comminality between them. Since there is no formal way in the XML spec to designate
            multiple orders through text, we need to use a specific schema. To know where the
            multiple orders in the text occur special/designated tags need to be placed. There are
            several steps in the collation pipeline that need be adjusted to make the collation tool
            aware of the multiple orders. During the tokenization phase/step all the tags involved
            in order need to be placed as metadata on the word tokens. This means that subst/del/add
            tags will not be collated as separate tokens. It is not usefull to know that one
            transcription has a subst tag and the other does not for example, it is only useful to
            find the order through the witnesses that best fits the content.  </para>
